Separate Horizon and OpenStack Dashboard
========================================

Matthias Runge <mrunge@redhat.com>
----------------------------------

OpenStack Summit Hong Kong, Fall 2013

----

Scope
-----

* Why?
* Horizon is the framework
* OpenStack Dashboard the reference implementation
* most commits involve just one part

----

Reasons not to split
--------------------

* overhead when coordinating changes to both projects
* overhead for initial separation
* is horizon stable enough?

----

Speaking on favor of dividing
-----------------------------

* promoting horizon as a framework might attract new developers
* build dashboards based on restful services
* not necessary to enable creation of a dashboard for OpenStack to be consumed by  mobile users
