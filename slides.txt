Separate Horizon and OpenStack Dashboard
========================================

Matthias Runge <mrunge@redhat.com>
----------------------------------

OpenStack Summit Hong Kong, Fall 2013

----

Scope
-----

* This is intended to get to a decision wether to split the two packages
* Horizon is the framework
* OpenStack Dashboard the reference implementation
* most commits involve just one part

----

Reasons not to split
--------------------

* overhead when coordinating changes to both projects
* overhead for initial separation
* is horizon stable enough?
* scare contributors away

----

Speaking on favor of dividing
-----------------------------

* promoting horizon as a framework might attract new developers
* build dashboards based on restful services
* not necessary to enable creation of a mobile dashboard for OpenStack
* keeping code basis smaller

----

Next
----

* Blueprint is filed, linked to the session proposal
* New name for the split off component?

----

* Input from discussion should be taken to the etherpad 
* https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Separate-Horizon-and-OpenStack-Dashboard
