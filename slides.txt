Separate Horizon and OpenStack Dashboard
========================================

Matthias Runge <mrunge@redhat.com>
----------------------------------

Nov 5th, 2013 OpenStack Summit Hong Kong

----

Scope
-----

* This is intended to get to a decision wether to split the two packages
* Horizon is the framework
* OpenStack Dashboard the reference implementation
* most commits involve either horizon or openstack_dashboard

----

Reasons not to split
--------------------

* overhead when coordinating changes to both projects
* overhead for initial separation
* is horizon stable enough?
* scare contributors away
* given, there are just a few contributors, a split might delay reviews

----

Speaking on favor of division
-----------------------------

* promoting horizon as a standalone framework might attract new people
* build dashboards based on RESTful services unconnected to OpenStack
* New projects like creation of a mobile dashboard for OpenStack
* keeping code basis smaller
* most code is already separated, besides

  * doc/
  * tools/
  * License, README.rst, run_tests.sh, setup.py, tox.ini, {test-,}requirements.txt

Next
----

* Blueprint is filed, linked to the session proposal
* Open discussion:

    * New name for the split off component?
    * Input from discussion should be taken to the etherpad 
    * https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Separate-Horizon-and-OpenStack-Dashboard
