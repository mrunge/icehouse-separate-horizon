Horizon provides a framework to provide a dashboard consuming restful services
openstack dashboard is the sample implementation.

those two packages can be seen independently, in fact, commits often just 
involve openstack_dashboard, and not so often Horizon.
Still, there are patches, inflicting both, like to recent one:
"Avoid discarding precision of metering data". Allover all, horizon is a more
slow moving target, compared with e.g nova or even with openstack_dashboard.

speaking against separation of both: 
- overhead when coordinating changes on both
- overhead for initial separation

speaking in favor of dividing:
- promoting horizon as a framework on top of Django to implement Dashboards
which consume RESTful services. One could think of implementing a Dashboard
solely targeted for Swift, to stay in OpenStack context, but I think, you'll
have other examples handy.
- attract other developers to work with Horizon even without the need of
installing OpenStack at all

- do we need another ptl? No, I don't think so, right now.
